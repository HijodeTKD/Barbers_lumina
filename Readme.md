MVC - PHP8 - MySQL - CSS - SASS

//DESCRIPTION:
Hello! This is a project created mostly in PHP, CSS(SASS), JS & MYSQL database.
Barber's Lumina simulates a barbershop business. We will be able to create users, send e-mails and verify them by token.

As a user we can book an appointment with any of the services available on a specific date. We can also see our following appointments and cancel them.
As a business administrator we can consult the appointments that we have any day and cancel them. We will also be able to add edit or delete the services of our business.

All appointments shown to both (Users & admins) will show date, client contact data, services and the total price of all the services that the client has booked.

//HOW MAKE IT WORKS

I post Barber's Lumina webapp on heroku, so you can join as a user and test the app creating your own account or use this as user example:

Url: https://obscure-lowlands-28552.herokuapp.com/

email: user@user.com
pass: 123456aB

If you want to test as an admin you can use the following credentials:

email: admin@admin.com
pass: 123456aB

I aprreciate any suggestion or improvement in the code, thanks for your time ^-^/
